To do:


+ Inventory
	- Inventory and ship "character sheet" will open up on the extreme left of the screen
	- The "Sheet" will be a black square with 50% opacity (or there about).
	- At the top a green (?) perspective image of the ship with it's basic stats
	- Below that a schematic image of the ship with the various upgrade slots (and damage indicators?)
	- At the bottom a grid with ship's cargo space
	- Each grid square is 32 x 32 px
	- Each grid square is an object? Or each item is an object?
	- What about the guns and stuff that also follow the ship around?!!
		Maybe they should not? Maybe an offset should be set and then the shots should be fired from
		with the owner-coordinates as base?

	- Create collision tests for all obPickUp (if Flight mode is turned off?)
	- The pickup objects should follow the mouse
	- If a pickup object is released over a slot, the object should become a part of it
	- If a pickup object is released when the inventory window is off, or outside of it, it
		should spinn for a while (use friction to slow it down?)
	- Create scripts for turning the inventory on and off (hiding the objects)


+ Ship to ship collision (Test!)

+ Exit ship (Test!)


- Experiment with a particle system for Control Thrusters

- Add sounds for various things (should there be an Audio Controller?):
	- PCG fireing
	- Plasma impact
	- Ship explosion
	- Ship collision
	- Pickup object
	- Enter Airlock
	- Engine

	

- Jetisson animation (cannot be fully implemented before inventory)
RotationDirection = choose(5, -5); // This goes in the step event!
FallOff = 1; // This goes in the step event!

// Rotate the object while it is moving, but slow it down over time
direction = direction + (RotationDirection / FallOff);

// Also lower the speed gradually
speed = speed / 1.005;

// Increase the fall off variable to slow down rotation and speed gradually
FallOff = FallOff + 0.01;


- AI behaviour:
	- Patrol
	- Roam
	- Attack
	- Flee
	- Enter Ship
	- Pickup Object

- Zone creation:
	- Zone Environment (asteroids, scrap field)
	- Zone Community (space station, pirate base)

* Screen shake

* The suits should not move very fast, and they should probably turn even slower!

* Particle system for Engines

* Check how the pirate is targeting enemies now. I think he targets his own Scimitar ship now
already before he enters it!

* Fix the plasma impact effect

* Check hitpoints (of the Owner) from each ship to see if the ship should explode
and a new ship should be created

* A suit needs two sets of stats, one where they store their suit stats (SuitHitPoints) and one
they use when sitting in a ship (Hitpoints). A ship however only need one set of points.

* Change ShipHitPoints and the like to be just HitPoints. The SuitHitPoints and ShipHitpoints
are variables where we store the inherent stats, HitPoints is where we store the current stats.

* FireOrder does not seem to work
	The problem is that the PCG checks it's Owner for fire order, but now the ship is the owner,
	not the suit!

* image_angle for obPirate
